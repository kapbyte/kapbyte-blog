### Who am I?

Hi there 👋. My name is Kelechi Chinaka.

- 💼 Software Engineer @[Evolance Technologies](https://www.evolancetechnologies.com/).

- 🧑🏻‍💻 Tech stacks: JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Swift, and more.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love watching comedy movies/skits. 

### Why this blog?
Over the course of my career working as a Software Engineer, I've had the opportunity to work and learn from some of the smartest people in the industry.

I started this blog because I want to share my journey in tech, writing, and stuff I'm learning. Having this blog will be a great avenue to share my story and journey as I go through life.

I hope through this medium I can connect with people in the tech community and learn from their journeys too.
